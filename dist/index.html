        <h1>Skyrim Perks</h1>
      </section>
      <section>
        Perks are a feature introduced in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Every
        time a level is gained, a point is granted to spend on a perk. However,
        points do not need to be used immediately; they can be saved for use
        later if the Dragonborn does not have the Skill Level required to have
        that perk. Most perks will have certain requirements before they can be
        chosenâ€”for instance, perks after the first point in Shield Wall require
        a Block level of 20 or higher. High-end perks, such as Shield Charge,
        require a Block level of 100. Skill prerequisites aside, most perks for
        a given skill depend upon a previously obtained perk. The exception
        being the starting perk, that must be obtained first in order to obtain
        any other perks for that skill. The skills of Destruction, Restoration,
        Alteration, Heavy Armor, Sneak, Lockpicking, Pickpocket, and Speech all
        have a perk dependency structure that is similar to a rooted tree. Hence
        the term, perk tree. Some perks in a tree cannot be obtained by looping
        around another path, after reaching the end of the tree. An example of
        this is on the Smithing tree. The Daedric Smithing perk, which comes
        before the Dragon Armor perk, cannot be obtained from the left side of
        the tree, despite the Dragon Armor perk being visibly joined to the
        Glass Armor perk. Perks are detailed on the individual skill pages,
        along with their requirements.

        <h3>Perk limit</h3>
        There are 251 perks in the game. Originally, there was a level cap of
        81, which meant a maximum of 80 perks could be acquired. As of patch
        1.9, this limit has been lifted with the addition of Legendary Skills.
        This addition grants the ability to level up past 81 by resetting skills
        trees back to level 15. Doing this gives back perk points spent on the
        skill to use on other locked perks while also letting the Dragonborn
        level up and upgrade their health, magicka, or stamina indefinitely. One
        can have all two-hundred and fifty-one perks by level 252.

        <h3>Perk points refund</h3>
        With the addition of Dragonborn add-on, and after completing the quest
        "At the Summit of Apocrypha" the player is granted the option to refund
        all the perks points in any Skill tree at the cost of one Dragon Soul.
        The perks are returned and can be spent elsewhere. This can be done to
        each skill tree as many times as liked so long as the player has Dragon
        Souls to spend. The player can return to the area any time they want by
        reading the Black Book: Waking Dreams anywhere on Solstheim.
